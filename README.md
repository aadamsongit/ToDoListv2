ToDoList returns:

This is the ToDoList App from before, but now it has a database. For this project, I used Node.js and Express.js with MongoDB.

Significantly, the project is deployed with Heroku @ https://thawing-mountain-77335.herokuapp.com/

For deployment, I created a cluster with MongoDB Atlas and integrated with Heroku. This project was very useful in giving me some deployment experience and experience with Atlas, both of which have given me a good boost of confidence and some good hands-on experience.
